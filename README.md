Tired of the abundance of phone cleaners on the play store? Tired of them being
extremely shady? Tired of them doing nothing? Tired of ads? Tired of having to
pay? Me too.

There are simply way too many apps out there that claim to speed up your device.
In reality, they don't do anything. LTE Cleaner only aims to clean your phone by
removing safe to delete files, which not only frees up a lot of space, but also
improve your privacy. Since LTE Cleaner removes .log files, which well, log what
you do.

**LTE Cleaner is 100% free, open source, ad free, and deletes everything it
claims to.**
